# Silver ERC-20 Token Solidity Contract

This project implements a basic ERC-20 token called *Silver* (SLVR) on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract includes features such as minting, burning, and transferring tokens. Only the contract owner can mint new tokens, while any user can burn and transfer tokens. This is a great example of a simple token contract built with Solidity and OpenZeppelin libraries, ideal for understanding token management on the Ethereum network. Feel free to change the token name and symbol. :)

## Features

1. **Token Information**:
   - Name: `Silver`
   - Symbol: `SLVR`
   - Total Supply: Dynamically updated with minting and burning operations.

2. **Token Functionalities**:
   - **Minting**: Only the contract owner can mint new tokens to a specified address.
   - **Burning**: Any user can burn their own tokens, reducing the total supply.
   - **Transferring**: Any user can transfer their tokens to other addresses.

3. **Access Control**:
   - The **minting** function is restricted to the contract owner using OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` contract.
   - The **burning** and **transferring** functions are accessible to all token holders.

## Requirements

- [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) (for contract deployment and testing)
- Solidity version `^0.8.0`
- OpenZeppelin Contracts for ERC-20 functionality, Ownable, and Burnable extensions

---

## Installation

1. Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
2. Create a new file and name it anything you want depending on the token you would create
3. Paste the contract code into the new file.
4. Compile the contract using the Remix Solidity compiler (version `^0.8.0`).
5. Deploy the contract using Remixâ€™s **Deploy & Run** tab:
   - Choose the **Injected Web3** environment (MetaMask or another Ethereum wallet connected).
   - Deploy the contract.

## Usage

1. **Minting Tokens**:
   - Only the contract owner can mint tokens. Use the `mint` function to mint a specific amount of tokens to any address.
   - Example: `mint(address, amount)`.

2. **Transferring Tokens**:
   - Any user can transfer tokens to another address using the `transfer` function.
   - Example: `transfer(toAddress, amount)`.

3. **Burning Tokens**:
   - Any user can burn a specified amount of their tokens using the `burn` function.
   - Example: `burn(amount)`.
